in this project the implementation of a chat with cryptographic message sending and
UDP technology using the Python 3.6 programming language is presented.
The chat has only been improved, not created from scratch. 
The video I took as a basis: https: //www.youtube.com/watch? V = PkfwX ....
I redesigned this chat so that users can communicate at the same time without updating the chat.
I also added cryptographic message sending to the server and reading the encrypted message by the client.
Good luck
